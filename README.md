To EVERYONE who doesn't know how to install packs..
First of all, you're stupid.
Second of all, download the file from planetminecraft.com or from here.
Then, drop the pack in Appdata by searching in Windows Search or using WINDOWS KEY + R. Then, type in whatever you're using, %appdata%. This will bring you where Minecraft is found. Now, go in ResourcePacks, and drop it in, and there you go!
